# D33---CLUSTERING-DATA
 This project applies KMeans and Hierarchical clustering techniques to the Iris dataset to explore unsupervised learning. The species column is excluded, and the effectiveness of each algorithm is demonstrated through clustering and visualization. The project includes an evaluation of cluster quality using silhouette analysis for better insights.

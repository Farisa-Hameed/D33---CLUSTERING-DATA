# D33---CLUSTERING-DATA
This project focuses on clustering techniques applied to the Iris dataset, a classic real-world dataset containing measurements of iris flowers. 
The objective is to evaluate the application of two clustering algorithms: KMeans Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering. 
The species column is excluded to emphasize unsupervised learning.
For each algorithm, the working principle is explained, its suitability for the Iris dataset is discussed, and the clusters are visualized. 
Additionally, the project assesses clustering performance using techniques such as silhouette analysis to provide insights into the structure of the data.
